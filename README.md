# PTtoolbox
Thermobarometry application for pressure-temperature modelling of metamorphic rocks.

The initial 1.0 release of PTtoolbox offers the ability to rapidly perform thermobarometry calculations using a variety of published thermometers from the following mineral pairs: garnet-biotite, garnet-chlorite, garnet-cordierite, garnet-clinopyroxene, garnet-hornblende, garnet-ilmenite, garnet-phengite and garnet-orthopyroxene. Additional thermometers and barometers will be added in future updates along with other useful tools related to the pressure-temperature modelling of metamorphic rocks. 

Developed by Joshua Laughton with the MATLAB App Designer.
